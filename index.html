      <h2>The Four Series</h2>
      <p>
        There are four series of Blackadder, each set in a different historical
        period. There were also some Christmas specials, but the less said about
        them, the better.
      </p>
      <h3>Series 1: The Black Adder</h3>
      <h4>Historical setting</h4>
      <p>Set in 1485 during the reign of (the fictional) Richard IV.</p>
      <h4>Key characters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Prince Edmund, "The Black Adder" <em>(Rowan Atkinson)</em></li>
        <li>Baldrick <em>(Tony Robinson)</em></li>
        <li>Lord Percy Percy <em>(Tim McInnerny)</em></li>
        <li>King Richard IV <em>(Brian Blessed)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every time I watch this series, I am pleasantly surprised to find that
        it isn't as bad as I remember it being. It's still not a patch on the
        later three series, but it does have some good moments. Baldrick is
        perhaps the smartest character of them all, trying his best to save his
        dimwitted boss from the errors of his foolhardy schemes to
        seize the crown from his father and brother. Brian Blessed is, of
        course, an utter delight.
      </p>
      <h3>Series 2: Blackadder II</h3>
      <h4>Historical setting</h4>
      <p>Set during the reign of Elizabeth I.</p>
      <h4>Key characters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Edmund, Lord Blackadder <em>(Rowan Atkinson)</em></li>
        <li>Baldrick <em>(Tony Robinson)</em></li>
        <li>Lord Percy Percy <em>(Tim McInnerny)</em></li>
        <li>Queenie <em>(Miranda Richardson)</em></li>
        <li>Lord Melchett <em>(Stephen Fry)</em></li>
        <li>Nursie <em>(Patsy Byrne)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think this is my favourite of all the series, though it's a close run
        thing between this and series 4. The character of Edmund is established
        as cunning, witty and shrewd, as he tries to maintain his position in court
        while vying with his rival Melchett for the Queen's favour, treading
        carefully to ensure the whims of the terrifyingly fickle Queenie don't
        result in his death warrant.
      </p>
      <h3>Series 3: Blackadder the Third</h3>
      <h4>Historical setting</h4>
      <p>Set in the late 18th century during the Regency period.</p>
      <h4>Key characters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Edmund Blackadder esquire <em>(Rowan Atkinson)</em></li>
        <li>Baldrick <em>(Tony Robinson)</em></li>
        <li>Prince George the Prince Regent <em>(Hugh Laurie)</em></li>
        <li>Mrs Miggins <em>(Helen Atkinson-Wood)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hugh Laurie is a brilliant addition to the regular cast in this series.
        Another idiot that the intelligent but acerbic Edmund has to deal with,
        he has some wonderful comic moments and is blissfully unaware of how his
        manservant manipulates him to his own advantage. There are some
        excellent guest cast appearances from regulars in other series too,
        including Stephen Fry as the Duke of Wellington, and Miranda Richardson
        as a squirrel-hating highwayman.
      </p>
      <h3>Series 4: Blackadder Goes Forth</h3>
      <h4>Historical setting</h4>
      <p>Set during the First World War.</p>
      <h4>Key characters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Edmund Blackadder <em>(Rowan Atkinson)</em></li>
        <li>Baldrick <em>(Tony Robinson)</em></li>
        <li>Lieutenant George <em>(Hugh Laurie)</em></li>
        <li>General Melchett <em>(Stephen Fry)</em></li>
        <li>Captain Darling <em>(Tim McInnerny)</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This series amazingly manages to both give an insight into how truly
        terrible the war was, and also be incredibly funny. The ingenuity (and
        increasing ridiculousness) of Edmund's plans to escape the trenches are
        a joy to behold. The poignancy of the final scene of the final episode,
        when they finally "go over the top", is a true moment of TV
        history.

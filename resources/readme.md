# Pre-Course Challenge: A Tribute Page

I chose to do my tribute page on Blackadder, as it's one of the finest British sitcoms of all time.

## How I found the process

It was a fun project. I like being able to start with a blank page, fill it up and make it look good. I've used HTML and CSS before so that part wasn't new to me, but it was still enjoyable. 

### ID vs tags?

I was confused as to why the instructions required an element to be given the id='main', when if you're using semantic HTML tags you could just use &lt;main>. Having a &lt;main> tag and then giving it an id of main seems unnecessary. Is there a reason why you'd need to do this?

### Where I need help

I have used GitHub before but never cloned an existing repository, so I'm not sure if I did it right - I seem to now have 3 branches in the repo: a master, a main, and a feedback. The master branch says it's "one commit ahead, two commits behind main." I created a git repository on my computer (which it called 'master') before cloning the existing GitHub one, so that might be the issue. Do I need to merge the master and main branches now?
